# Covid-Predictor
This Covid Predictor is a website which gets details from user and predicting whether he/she has high chance of having covid or not.
We have taken a dataset which has the past details of the symptoms experienced and their affection of the disease. So, We have trained a model to get the symptoms experienced by the user like their name, age and whether they have breathing problem, fever, dry cough, sore throat, hypertension etcâ€¦
Tools: Google Collab (Python), Python Flask Server (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Usability: It is a self-testing app where the people can test for themselves which helps them to 
avoid contact with others.
Implementation: We have implemented and deployed it as a website.
Technology Stack: Model Building - Logistic regression.
Here is a small demo of our project.
